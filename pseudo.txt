# First: Basic Functions

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide 

## Notes:
* Make the following variables: firstNum, operator, secondNum (these will be used later for display).
* Enable key presses for numbers and assignment operators.


# Secondly: Function operator()

* Takes in the above-mentioned variables and calls one of the four functions on the variables.


# Thirdly: HTML Calculator

* Buttons for each digit, operator, decimal place, display, etc. (see link for inspiration https://mrbuddh4.github.io/calculator/)

## The Structure
-> main calc container (border grey and background-color black)
-> display div, fills the full width of the calc container
-> grid of 4 x 4 holding values
-> 3 grid-squares, with the first one being 2x the size of one grid-square (for the zero digit)

# Fourthly: Working Calculator 

* Store the first number and second, using the operator the user clicks and outputting the answer when the "=" clicked.
### Example: User clicks 7 + 5 (store 12) - 4 (subtract 4 from 12) = (output 8)

* Round answers to 3 decimals
* Take note of users pressing "=" before typing digits
* Clear needs to wipe all data
* Watch out for division of zero + alert user a message in display.
* Add backspace to allow one digit to be removed per backspace click.
